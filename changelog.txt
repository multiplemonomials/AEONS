O TESTING!

KNOWN ISSUES/MISSING FEATURES:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
//X means fixed, O means still wild

X gcodes.cpp: will crash/behave unexpectedly if G1 with NO ARGUMENTS is recieved

X AEONS_Config.h: move movement settings from Printer.cpp Axis constructor calls

X Movement.cpp: Max feedrate? What max feedrate?

X Movement.cpp: use functors to fix the delay time floating point issues

_______________________________________________________________________

O Movemement.cpp: only enable axes when we need to and disable them after we're done

O Heater.cpp: MAX6675 support unimplemented

O Calculation of max feedrates needs to take angle into account. (?)

O assserts.h: ASSERT2 is broken (needs verification)

O Movement.cpp: Software endstops? What software endstops?

O Movement.cpp: Add a debug thing to measure the algorithm time
