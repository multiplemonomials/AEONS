/* Changelog/Features in v-0.4 ALPHA (Prototype X-1...)

*linear move algorithm FINALLY written

*added Pin object family

*???

v0.1 CHECKLIST:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
X linear move algorithm

X Fix G1 call

X fix syntax highlighting for AEONS.cpp

O step test code

X Axis object

O inactivity timeout

O Multiple extruder support

O Final code review

O TESTING!

KNOWN ISSUES/MISSING FEATURES:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
//X means fixed, O means still wild

X gcodes.cpp: will crash/behave unexpectedly if G1 with NO ARGUMENTS is recieved

X AEONS_Config.h: move movement settings from Printer.cpp Axis constructor calls

X Movement.cpp: Max feedrate? What max feedrate?

X Movement.cpp: use functors to fix the delay time floating point issues

X Movement.cpp: Add a debug thing to measure the algorithm time

X Movement.cpp: Software endstops? What software endstops?

_______________________________________________________________________

O Movemement.cpp: only enable axes when we need to and disable them after we're done

O Heater.cpp: MAX6675 support unimplemented

O Device.h: PWM fans unimplemented

O Calculation of max feedrates needs to take angle into account. (?)

O Change pinMode calls to use Pin objects

O Change pins.h to fix compiler warnings by separating board and board version

O AEONS.cpp:verify() needs to verify the code checksum as well as the line number

O possible future support for RS485 communications bus/Gen3 electronics

O possibly create a set of extruder_controller objects so Gen3 support can be added
