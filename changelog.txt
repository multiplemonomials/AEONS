/* Changelog/Features in v0.1 BETA (an unknown quantity...)

*Added multi-extruder support

*fixed infamous moving-wrong-axes-in-relative-mode bug

*cleaned up config file

*inactivity timeout

Beta Release CHECKLIST:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
X linear move algorithm

X Fix G1 call

X fix syntax highlighting for AEONS.cpp

X step test code

X Axis object

X inactivity timeout

X Multiple extruder support

? Final code review

? TESTING!

KNOWN ISSUES/MISSING FEATURES:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
//X means fixed, O means still wild

X gcodes.cpp: will crash/behave unexpectedly if G1 with NO ARGUMENTS is recieved

X AEONS_Config.h: move movement settings from Printer.cpp Axis constructor calls

X Movement.cpp: Max feedrate? What max feedrate?

X Movement.cpp: use functors to fix the delay time floating point issues

X Movement.cpp: Add a debug thing to measure the algorithm time

X Movement.cpp: Software endstops? What software endstops?

X Movemement.cpp: only enable axes when we need to and disable them after we're done

X speed up endstop code

X Change pins.h to fix compiler warnings by separating board and board version

X AEONS.cpp:verify() needs to verify the code checksum as well as the line number
_______________________________________________________________________

O Heater.cpp: MAX6675 support unimplemented

O Device.h: PWM fans unimplemented

O Calculation of max feedrates needs to take angle into account. (?)

O Change pinMode calls to use Pin objects, particularly in heater code

O possible future support for RS485 communications bus/Gen3 electronics

O add an extended Axis object for different motor drivers

O Change built-in types to C types (uint8_t, etc)

O Unit test for verify()?

O Unit tests for movement code
